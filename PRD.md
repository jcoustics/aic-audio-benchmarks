# Product Requirements Document: Audio Enhancement Demo Page

## Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for a demo webpage that showcases our audio enhancement technology by comparing subtractive AI approaches with our generative AI solution through visual spectrograms and audio playback.

---

## Product Purpose

**Goal**: Create an interactive demo page that effectively communicates the superiority of our generative AI audio enhancement technology over traditional subtractive AI methods.

**Target Audience**:
- Potential enterprise clients
- Audio professionals and engineers
- Product decision-makers
- Technical evaluators

---

## Core User Stories

### Public Users

1. As a potential client, I want to see visual proof of audio quality differences so I can understand the technical advantages of the product.

2. As an audio professional, I want to compare different audio artifacts side-by-side so I can evaluate the enhancement capabilities.

3. As a decision-maker, I want a clear, simple demonstration so I can quickly grasp the value proposition without technical expertise.

### Admin Users

4. As an admin, I want to upload and manage audio samples and spectrograms through a secure interface so I can update the demo content without touching code.

5. As an admin, I want to authenticate securely to prevent unauthorized access to content management features.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Page Layout & Structure

**Header Section**
- Page title: "Subtractive vs. Generative"
- Clean, professional design with ample whitespace
- Responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile devices

**Content Section**
- Explanatory text describing the comparison
- Spectrogram visualization area
- Audio playback controls
- Clear labeling of different audio artifact types

### 2. Spectrogram Visualization

**Display Requirements**
- Show time-frequency representations of audio signals
- Support multiple audio artifact types:
  - Distortion (excessive energy in certain frequencies)
  - Reverb (blurred signal)
  - Bandlimiting (frequency range cutoff)
  - Codec artifacts (small gaps in frequency response)

**Visual Characteristics**
- High-resolution spectrogram images
- Clear frequency axis (vertical)
- Clear time axis (horizontal)
- Color-coded intensity mapping
- Side-by-side or sequential comparison layout

**Comparison Views**
- "Before" state showing degraded audio
- "After" state showing enhanced audio
- Clear visual distinction between subtractive AI results and generative AI results

### 3. Audio Playback System

**Playback Controls**
- Play/pause button for each audio sample
- Volume control
- Progress indicator/scrubber
- Sample selection (different artifact types)

**Audio Samples Required**
- Original degraded recordings demonstrating:
  - Distortion
  - Reverb
  - Bandlimiting
  - Codec artifacts
- Enhanced versions using:
  - Subtractive AI approach
  - Our generative AI approach
- Reference "studio quality" sample (if applicable)

### 4. Educational Content

**Explanatory Text**
- Brief description of what spectrograms show
- Explanation of each artifact type:
  - **Distortion**: Adds excessive energy to certain frequencies
  - **Reverb**: Blurs the signal across time
  - **Bandlimiting**: Complete loss of information in specific frequency ranges
  - **Codec artifacts**: Small gaps in frequency response

**Value Proposition Messaging**
- Clear statement: "Current subtractive AI models have limited capabilities"
- Differentiation: "Our approach reconstructs missing information"
- Outcome: "Delivers studio-quality voice recording"

### 5. Interaction Design

**User Flow**
1. User lands on page and reads introductory text
2. User views spectrogram comparisons
3. User plays audio samples to hear differences
4. User switches between different artifact types
5. User compares subtractive vs. generative results

**Interactive Elements**
- Hover states on playback controls
- Active states for selected samples
- Smooth transitions between states
- Loading indicators for audio buffering
